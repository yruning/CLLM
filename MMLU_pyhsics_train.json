The total charge remains the same, so:\n     \\[\n     C \\cdot V_0 = C \\cdot V_f + \\frac{C}{2} \\cdot V_f\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     C \\cdot V_0 = C \\cdot V_f + \\frac{C}{2} \\cdot V_f = \\frac{3C}{2} \\cdot V_f\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( V_f \\):\n     \\[\n     V_f = \\frac{2}{3} V_0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Voltage on the First Capacitor:**\n   - The final voltage on the first capacitor is \\( V_f = \\frac{2}{3} V_0 \\).\n\nHowever, it seems there was a mistake in the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:\n\n- The charge on the first capacitor initially is \\( Q = C \\cdot V_0 \\).\n- After redistribution, the total charge \\( Q \\) is shared across the three capacitors, which are effectively in parallel after the connection.\n- The equivalent capacitance of the two series capacitors is \\( \\frac{C}{2} \\), and they are in parallel with the first capacitor, so the total capacitance is:\n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{total}} = C + \\frac{C}{2} = \\frac{3C}{2}\n  \\]\n- The final voltage \\( V_f \\) across each capacitor is given by:\n  \\[\n  V_f = \\frac{Q}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{C \\cdot V_0}{\\frac{3C}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3} V_0\n  \\]\n\nUpon reviewing the options, it seems there is a discrepancy. The correct answer based on the calculation should be \\( \\frac{2}{3} V_0 \\), but this is not listed among the options. If the options are indeed as given, there might be an error in the problem statement or options.\n\n### The correct answer based on the calculation should be \\( \\frac{2}{3} V_0 \\), but this is not listed among the options provided."

The Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 meters for a black hole with the mass of the Sun is consistent with this formula.\n\nIf the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the gravitational field at any point outside the Schwarzschild radius would remain unchanged. This is because the gravitational field depends only on the mass and the distance from the center of mass, not on the size or nature of the object.\n\nTherefore, the orbits of the planets, which are determined by the gravitational force, would remain unchanged. The planets would continue to orbit the black hole in the same way they orbit the Sun, following the same elliptical paths as before. The only difference would be that the source of gravity is now a black hole rather than a star, but since the mass is the same, the gravitational influence is identical.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) The planets would move directly toward the Sun.  \nThis is incorrect because the gravitational force remains the same, so the planets would not suddenly move toward the center.\n\n(B) The planets would move in spiral orbits.  \nThis is incorrect because spiral orbits would imply a change in the gravitational force or an additional force, which is not the case here.\n\n(C) The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits.  \nThis is incorrect because there is no change in the gravitational force that would cause oscillations. The orbits remain stable and unchanged.\n\nSince none of the options provided accurately describe the situation, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the options. The correct understanding is that the orbits of the planets would remain unchanged, continuing in their elliptical paths as they did when the Sun was present.\n\n### The correct interpretation is that the orbits of the planets would remain unchanged. However, if we must choose from the given options, none accurately describe this scenario. The planets would continue their elliptical orbits as before. ###"

        "target": "The BCS theory, named after Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer, explains superconductivity in terms of the formation of Cooper pairs. In a superconductor, electrons form pairs known as Cooper pairs, which can move through the lattice without resistance. The attraction between the electrons in a Cooper pair is not due to the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, or vacuum polarization. Instead, it is due to an effective attraction mediated by lattice vibrations, known as phonons.\n\nWhen an electron moves through the lattice, it causes a slight distortion in the lattice structure, attracting nearby positive ions. This distortion can attract another electron, leading to an effective attraction between the two electrons, despite their natural repulsion due to their like charges.

Therefore, the speed is not zero at the top of the trajectory; only the vertical component of the velocity is zero. This statement is false.\n\n(C) The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.\n- In projectile motion, the horizontal component of velocity remains constant (assuming no air resistance), but the vertical component changes due to gravity. As a result, the total speed of the projectile changes throughout its flight. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nNone of the given statements are true for an ideal projectile launched at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the horizontal.

Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object, and it is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W = m \\cdot g \\]\n\nwhere \\( W \\) is the weight, \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a planet is given by:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{G \\cdot M}{R^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the planet, and \\( R \\) is the radius of the planet.\n\nOn Earth, the astronaut's weight is 800 N, which means:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{Earth}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the new planet. The mass of the planet is twice that of Earth (\\( M_{\\text{planet}} = 2M_{\\text{Earth}} \\)), and the radius is also twice that of Earth (\\( R_{\\text{planet}} = 2R_{\\text{Earth}} \\)).\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on the new planet is:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{\\text{planet}}}{R_{\\text{planet}}^2} = \\frac{G \\cdot (2M_{\\text{Earth}})}{(2R_{\\text{Earth}})^2} \\]\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{2G \\cdot M_{\\text{Earth}}}{4R_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{G \\cdot M_{\\text{Earth}}}{R_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\]\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} \\]\n\nThis means the acceleration due to gravity on the new planet is half of that on Earth.\n\nTherefore, the astronaut's weight on the new planet will be:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{planet}} = m \\cdot g_{\\text{planet}} = m \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}}\\right) \\]\n\nSince \\( m \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} = 800 \\, \\text{N} \\), we have:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 800 \\, \\text{N} = 400 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nThe correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{G \\cdot (2M_{\\text{Earth}})}{(2R_{\\text{Earth}})^2} = \\frac{2G \\cdot M_{\\text{Earth}}}{4R_{\\text{Earth}}^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{G \\cdot M_{\\text{Earth}}}{R_{\\text{Earth}}^2} \\]\n\n\\[ g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g_{\\text{Earth}} \\]\n\nThe astronaut's weight on the new planet should be:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 800 \\, \\text{N} = 400 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nThis confirms that the weight should indeed be 400 N, but since this does not match any of the options, let's check the options again:\n\n"

Therefore, the velocity just after impact is approximately \\( -7.92 \\, \\text{m/s} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the change in momentum:**\n\n   The change in momentum (\\( \\Delta p \\)) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta p = m(v_{\\text{final}} - v_{\\text{initial}})\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( m = 0.08 \\, \\text{kg} \\), \\( v_{\\text{initial}} = 7.92 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and \\( v_{\\text{final}} = -7.92 \\, \\text{m/s} \\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta p = 0.08 \\times (-7.92 - 7.92) = 0.08 \\times (-15.84) = -1.2672 \\, \\text{kg m/s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the average force:**\n\n   The average force (\\( F_{\\text{avg}} \\)) exerted by the floor can be found using the impulse-momentum theorem:\n\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{avg}} \\times \\Delta t = \\Delta p\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( \\Delta t = 0.04 \\, \\text{s} \\).\n\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{-1.2672}{0.04} = -31.68 \\, \\text{N}\n   \\]\n\n   The negative sign indicates the direction of the force is opposite to the initial velocity direction. However, since we are asked for the magnitude of the force, we take the absolute value:\n\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{avg}} = 31.68 \\, \\text{N}\n   \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculated value. It seems there might be an error in the options given. However, based on the calculations, the average force exerted by the floor on the ball is approximately \\( 31.68 \\, \\text{N} \\).\n\n### Answer: None of the provided options are correct; the calculated average force is approximately 31.68 N."

The force is the negative derivative of the potential energy function, \\( F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} \\).\n   - First, find the derivative of \\( U(x) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}[(x - 2)^3 - 12x] = 3(x - 2)^2 - 12\n     \\]\n   - Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n     \\[\n     3(x - 2)^2 - 12 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (x - 2)^2 = 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x - 2 = \\pm 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the nature of the critical points**:\n   - To determine whether these points are positions of stable or unstable equilibrium, we need to check the second derivative of \\( U(x) \\), \\( \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \\).\n   - Compute the second derivative:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}[3(x - 2)^2 - 12] = 6(x - 2)\n     \\]\n   - Evaluate the second derivative at the critical points:\n     - At \\( x = 4 \\):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \\bigg|_{x=4} = 6(4 - 2) = 12 > 0\n       \\]\n       This indicates a local minimum, hence a stable equilibrium.\n     - At \\( x = 0 \\):\n       \\[\n       \\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} \\bigg|_{x=0} = 6(0 - 2) = -12 < 0\n       \\]\n       This indicates a local maximum, hence an unstable equilibrium.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The position of stable equilibrium is at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nHowever, the given options do not include \\( x = 4 \\). Let's re-evaluate the options provided:\n\n- (A) \\( x = -4 \\)\n- (B) \\( x = -2 \\)\n- (C) \\( x = 0 \\)\n\nSince none of these options match the stable equilibrium point \\( x = 4 \\) derived from the analysis, it appears there might be an error in the options provided. However, based on the analysis, the correct position of stable equilibrium is \\( x = 4 \\), which is not listed among the options.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct position of stable equilibrium is \\( x = 4 \\), but it is not listed in the given options. Therefore, none of the provided options (A, B, or C) represent a position of stable equilibrium."
